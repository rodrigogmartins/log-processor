## 1. 📐 Design & Architecture

- Prefer **composition** over inheritance — embed structs instead of subclassing.

- Design **small, focused interfaces** that describe behavior, not objects.

- Organize code by **domain or feature**, not by technical layer.

- Avoid creating “God objects” — structs should have clear, limited responsibility.

- Keep packages cohesive; avoid circular dependencies.

## 2. 🔧 Structs & Interfaces

- Use **structs** for data and behavior when needed, not as “classes.”

- Add methods to structs only when they logically belong there.

- Define **interfaces at the consumer side**, not the producer side.

- Don’t write getters/setters unless they add real logic or validation.

- Use factory functions (`NewX()`) instead of constructors.

## 3. 🧠 Mindset & Philosophy

- Embrace **simplicity and explicitness** — Go avoids “magic.”

- Don’t over-engineer abstractions — solve real problems first.

- Follow **idiomatic Go**: clear, readable, minimal.

- Prefer **composition, interfaces**, and **functions** over deep hierarchies.

- Read standard library code — it’s the best example of Go idioms.

## 4. 🧵 Memory & Pointers

- Use **pointers** when modifying a struct or avoiding large copies.

- Use **values** for small, immutable, or short-lived data.

- Remember that **maps** and **slices** are already reference types.

## 5. ⚡ Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly: `if err != nil { … }`.

- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("msg: %w", err)`.

- Avoid panic for control flow; use it only for truly exceptional cases.

- Remember: **no exceptions, no try/catch** — explicit handling wins.

## 6. 🧪 Testing & Mocking

- Use interfaces for mocking only when necessary.

- Keep tests simple and clear — Go favors integration tests.

- Avoid test frameworks with heavy magic; use `testing` and `testify`.

## 7. 🔄 Concurrency Tips

- Learn **goroutines** — they’re cheap and safe for concurrent work.

- Use **channels** for communication, not shared mutable state.

- Prefer context cancellation for graceful shutdowns.

- Avoid overusing sync primitives like `Mutex`; prefer message passing.

## 8. 📦 Project Organization

- Use `cmd/` for main entry points.

- Use `internal/` for private code.

- Use `pkg/` for reusable libraries (if needed).

- Keep `main.go` minimal — wire dependencies explicitly.

- Store configs in `.env` or a `config` package.
