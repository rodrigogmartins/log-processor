## 1. 🚀 Introduction

If you come from an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) background, Go might initially feel minimalistic or even “too simple”.
You may look for familiar constructs like classes, inheritance, annotations, generics, or frameworks, and not find them the same way.

But Go is designed with clarity, simplicity, and explicitness in mind — trading some abstraction for ease of reasoning, concurrency, and performance.

This guide highlights the main paradigm shifts you’ll encounter and provides pro-tips for writing idiomatic Go code.

## 2. 🧭 Summary

Go isn’t OOP — it’s **simple, pragmatic, and compositional**.

Embrace **structs, interfaces, and composition**, and you’ll write **cleaner, faster, and more maintainable** systems.

## 3. 🔄 OOP vs Go: Conceptual Shifts

| Concept                  | In OOP (e.g., Java)                                | In Go (Golang)                                                                          |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Classes                  | Blueprints that encapsulate data + behavior        | No classes. Use struct to model data and functions with receivers to attach behavior    |
| Inheritance              | Core mechanism for reuse and polymorphism          | No inheritance. Use composition and interfaces instead                                  |
| Interfaces               | Declared and implemented explicitly via implements | Implicit implementation: any type that has the required methods satisfies the interface |
| Access Modifiers         | public, private, protected keywords                | Simplicity: Capitalized = exported (public), lowercase = unexported (private)           |
| Constructors             | Defined by name of class                           | Use factory functions, e.g. NewSomething()                                              |
| Annotations / Reflection | Commonly used for frameworks                       | Rarely used — prefer explicit configuration                                             |
| Exceptions               | Error handling via try/catch                       | No exceptions. Handle errors via explicit error returns                                 |
| Framework-driven         | Heavy reliance on frameworks (Spring, etc.)        | Go prefers libraries + composition, not frameworks                                      |
| Generics                 | Widely used                                        | Go supports generics (since 1.18), but encourages simple concrete types where possible  |
| Dependency Injection     | Automated by frameworks                            | Manual DI via constructors or function parameters                                       |
| Multithreading           | Threads, executors, futures                        | Lightweight goroutines and channels for concurrency                                     |

> 🧭 Go’s philosophy: “Composition over inheritance, simplicity over abstraction.”

## 4. 💡 Key Mental Shifts

### 4.1. 🧱 Think in structs + functions, not classes

  You’ll often define a struct for data and implement behavior through receiver methods.

  ```go
    type User struct {
      Name string
    }

    func (u *User) Greet() string {
      return "Hello, " + u.Name
    }
  ```

### 4.2. 🧩 Use composition, not inheritance

  Embed structs to reuse fields and methods:

  ```go
    type Logger struct { ... }
    
    type Service struct {
      Logger // embedded struct
    }
  ```

### 4.3. 📝 Interfaces are contracts, not hierarchies

  Declare small interfaces close to where they’re used.
  Avoid large “god interfaces” — Go prefers small, focused ones like:
  
  ```go
    type Reader interface {
      Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
    }
  ```

### 4.4. 🧠 No hidden magic — Go favors explicit behavior

  What you see is what happens. Frameworks won’t inject behavior behind the scenes.

### 4.5. 🪓 Error handling is explicit

  You’ll write more checks, but code becomes predictable and clear.

## 5. 🧰 Pro Tips for Writing Idiomatic Go

### 5.1. 🧠 Code Design

- ✅ **Keep functions small and focused** — one responsibility per function.

- 🧪 **Prefer pure functions** when possible (no side effects).

- 🧱 **Use** `struct` to represent entities with state.

- **⚙️ Use methods with receivers** when behavior depends on internal state.

- 🧩 **Use interfaces** to decouple components and make testing easier.

  - Define **interfaces where they are used**, not globally.

- 🚀 **Favor composition** over inheritance.

- 🪶 **Avoid unnecessary abstraction** — Go values clarity over flexibility.

### 5.2. 📦 Data and Pointers

- 📌 **Use pointers** (`*Type`) when:

  - You need to modify the original value.

  - You want to avoid copying large structs.

- 📄 **Use values** (`Type`) when:

  - The data is small and immutable.

  - You want clear ownership (e.g., `Log` struct in search results).

### 5.3. 🧱 Structs as "Classes"

- Use `struct` for data + methods with receiver when behavior belongs to the entity.

- Example:

  ```go
    type LogService struct {
      esClient ElasticSearchClient
    }

    func (s *LogService) Process(log Log) error {
      // logic using internal state
    }
  ```

### 5.4. 🧩 Interfaces

- ✅ Keep them small (1-2 methods).

- 🚀 Define them at the **consumer side**, not producer.

- Example:

  ```go
    type ElasticSearchClient interface {
      Index(ctx context.Context, index string, id string, body interface{}) error
    }
  ```

### 5.5. 🧠 Error Handling

- Return `(result, error)` and handle errors immediately.

- Prefer clarity over cleverness:

```go
  res, err := doSomething()
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }
```

### 5.6. 🔄 Concurrency

- 🧵 Use goroutines (`go func() { ... }()`) for async tasks.

- 📡 Use **channels** for safe communication between goroutines.

- 🔐 Protect shared state with **sync.Mutex** or **channel patterns**.

## 6. 🧰 General Best Practices

- 🧭 Follow Go naming conventions:

  - Exported names **start with capital letters**.

  - Keep names **short and descriptive**.

- 📂 Organize code by **domain/package**, not layers.

- 🧪 Always test! Use `testing` package and keep tests in `*_test.go` files.

- ⚙️ Use `go fmt`, `go vet`, and `golangci-lint`.

## 7. 🚧 Common Pitfalls for OOP Developers

When transitioning from Java or other OOP languages to Go, it’s easy to bring habits that don’t fit the Go philosophy. Here are some common mistakes and how to avoid them:

### 7.1. 🧱 Trying to Build Class Hierarchies

- ❌ **Don’t**: Attempt to mimic inheritance with complex struct embedding or design deep hierarchies.

- ✅ **Do**: Use **composition** — embed structs for reuse and define small, focused **interfaces** for polymorphism.

### 7.2. 🧩 Overusing Interfaces

- ❌ **Don’t**: Create interfaces for every struct “just in case.”

- ✅ **Do**: Define interfaces **where they are used**, not where they are implemented. Go prefers **interface consumers**, not producers.

### 7.3. 🌀 Expecting Constructors and Setters

- ❌ **Don’t**: Try to enforce encapsulation through private fields and setter/getter methods.

- ✅ **Do**: Use simple **factory functions** (`NewType()`) and **exported fields** when appropriate. Keep things explicit and straightforward.

### 7.4. 🪄 Looking for Framework Magic

- ❌ **Don’t**: Expect dependency injection frameworks, annotations, or runtime reflection magic.

- ✅ **Do**: Embrace **explicit wiring and simple initialization**. Go favors clarity over automation.

### 7.5. 📦 Organizing by Layer Instead of Domain

- ❌ **Don’t**: Create separate `services/`, `controllers/`, `repositories/` folders like in typical OOP MVC projects.

- ✅ **Do**: Organize by **feature or domain** (e.g., `internal/logs/`) — this makes code easier to navigate and maintain.

### 7.6. 🧠 Misusing Pointers

- ❌ **Don’t**: Use pointers everywhere by default.

- ✅ **Do**: Use pointers only when you need to **modify a value**, **avoid copying large structs**, or **represent nil**. Primitive types and small structs often work best as values.

### 7.7. 🔄 Forgetting Error Handling Philosophy

- ❌ **Don’t**: Expect try/catch or unchecked exceptions.

- ✅ **Do**: Handle errors **explicitly** with `if err != nil` and wrap them when needed. This leads to more predictable, robust programs.

### 7.8. 🧪 Mocking with Interfaces Too Early

- ❌ **Don’t**: Abstract everything into interfaces just for tests.

- ✅ **Do**: Introduce interfaces **only when you have multiple implementations** or need mocking in tests.

### 7.9. 🧭 Expecting Runtime Type Safety

- ❌ **Don’t**: Depend on reflection or runtime type information to enforce behavior.

- ✅ **Do**: Leverage Go’s **static typing** and compiler checks; simplicity wins over metaprogramming.

### 7.10. 🚀 Ignoring Concurrency Primitives

- ❌ **Don’t**: Rely solely on threads or locks as in OOP.

- ✅ **Do**: Learn and use Go’s **goroutines** and **channels** — they’re lightweight and designed for safe, concurrent operations.

## 8. 🧭 Migration Checklist — From Java (OOP) to Go 🦫

### 8.1. 📐 Design & Architecture

- Prefer **composition** over inheritance — embed structs instead of subclassing.

- Design **small, focused interfaces** that describe behavior, not objects.

- Organize code by **domain or feature**, not by technical layer.

- Avoid creating “God objects” — structs should have clear, limited responsibility.

- Keep packages cohesive; avoid circular dependencies.

### 8.2. 🔧 Structs & Interfaces

- Use **structs** for data and behavior when needed, not as “classes.”

- Add methods to structs only when they logically belong there.

- Define **interfaces at the consumer side**, not the producer side.

- Don’t write getters/setters unless they add real logic or validation.

- Use factory functions (`NewX()`) instead of constructors.

### 8.3. 🧠 Mindset & Philosophy

- Embrace **simplicity and explicitness** — Go avoids “magic.”

- Don’t over-engineer abstractions — solve real problems first.

- Follow **idiomatic Go**: clear, readable, minimal.

- Prefer **composition, interfaces**, and **functions** over deep hierarchies.

- Read standard library code — it’s the best example of Go idioms.

### 8.4. 🧵 Memory & Pointers

- Use **pointers** when modifying a struct or avoiding large copies.

- Use **values** for small, immutable, or short-lived data.

- Remember that **maps** and **slices** are already reference types.

### 8.5. ⚡ Error Handling

- Handle errors explicitly: `if err != nil { … }`.

- Wrap errors with context using `fmt.Errorf("msg: %w", err)`.

- Avoid panic for control flow; use it only for truly exceptional cases.

- Remember: **no exceptions, no try/catch** — explicit handling wins.

### 8.6. 🧪 Testing & Mocking

- Use interfaces for mocking only when necessary.

- Keep tests simple and clear — Go favors integration tests.

- Avoid test frameworks with heavy magic; use `testing` and `testify`.

### 8.7. 🔄 Concurrency Tips

- Learn **goroutines** — they’re cheap and safe for concurrent work.

- Use **channels** for communication, not shared mutable state.

- Prefer context cancellation for graceful shutdowns.

- Avoid overusing sync primitives like `Mutex`; prefer message passing.

### 8.8. 📦 Project Organization

- Use `cmd/` for main entry points.

- Use `internal/` for private code.

- Use `pkg/` for reusable libraries (if needed).

- Keep `main.go` minimal — wire dependencies explicitly.

- Store configs in `.env` or a `config` package.
